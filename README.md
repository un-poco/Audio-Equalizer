# Audio-Equalizer
We use MATLAB to realize an audio equalizer, which can mainly change the music styles.  
There are two apps; App1 is based on sheet music（谱子）. And the music is generated through our processings.
* In the first interface, the user can choose the instrument as he like. 
* In the second interface, the users can change the music style, like pop, jazz, etc. They can also see the waveform in both the time domain and frequency domain. The before and after comparison can be easily seen.

App2 has similar functions to App1. A difference lies in that App2 is based on reading the .wav file. So users can choose any music .wav file as they like. We've also realized functions like vocal cancellation, speed change, tonal modification.
